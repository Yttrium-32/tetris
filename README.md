# Tetris


## Introduction

A very simple implementation of Tetris written in C using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/),
mostly for learning purposes. Made by following [this](https://youtu.be/kh3rkt6nZ2c) excellent video.


## Compiling

This project depends on SDL for the graphics and bear to generate the
compilation cache.
These packages are available on most package managers.

For example on Arch linux:
```
# pacman -S --needed sdl2 sdl2_ttf bear
```

To compile and run simple run `make` in the project root.
